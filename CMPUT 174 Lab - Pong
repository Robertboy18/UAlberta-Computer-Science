## Pong

The Pong game from Atari is one of the earliest arcade games. 
In this lab, you will create a graphical two-player Pong game. 
The left player controls the left paddle by pressing and holding down the q key to move the paddle up and the a key to move the paddle down.
The right player controls the right paddle by pressing and holding down the p key to move the paddle up and the l key to move the paddle down. 
These keys were chosen since q and a are on the left side of the keyboard and p and l are on the right side so both players can share a single keyboard and not get in each others way. 
Here is a video of the completed game:
