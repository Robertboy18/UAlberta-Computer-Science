These are all the Computer Science Courses I am taking in my first year.

**Introduction to the Foundations of Computation I- CMPUT 174**

**Overview**

>A problem-based introduction to Computing Science by writing a series of computer games in a high-level programming language called Python
Students will learn how to use infrastructure tools and resources to solve computational problems by applying a design process that creates a well-designed program that satisfies the problem requirements
 Students will master a group of data structures, control structures, programming constructs and techniques that can be used to solve a wide range of computational problems. They will use abstraction at all levels of the analysis design, testing and coding process to create reusable, reliable robust and efficient programs.
 
 **Objectives**
 >The course has two layers of objectives. Each shallow (obvious) objective has a deeper (underlying objective). The shallow version of the first objective is for students to learn to design, code, test and debug a range of simple games in Python so that they work as expected. The deeper version of this objective is that students can do the same for computational problems that are not computer games. The shallow version of the second objective is for students to learn how to construct highly interactive games that respond to users in real time. The deeper version of this objective is to learn to write highly interactive general application programs that respond in real time. The shallow version of the third objective is that students learn how to construct games that are sophisticated enough to include a complex dynamic virtual environment. The deeper version of this objective is that students learn to use a wide range of data structures, control structures and programming constructs. The shallow version of the fourth objective is that students write computer games that are capable of being stopped and then resumed again at a later time. the deep version of this objective is that students will learn how to design and use persistent data in their programs that is written to disk and read from disk.
 After completing the course, students should understand the concepts: object, class, selection control structure (if), repetition control structures (while, for), variable, function, function parameter, and sequences (Strings, Lists, Tuples, etc.). Students should be able to use these concepts to construct robust Python programs that solve computational problems.
