**1 - Introduction to the Foundations of Computation I- CMPUT 174**

**Objectives**
 >The course has two layers of objectives. Each shallow (obvious) objective has a deeper (underlying objective). The shallow version of the first objective is for students to learn to design, code, test and debug a range of simple games in Python so that they work as expected. The deeper version of this objective is that students can do the same for computational problems that are not computer games. The shallow version of the second objective is for students to learn how to construct highly interactive games that respond to users in real time. The deeper version of this objective is to learn to write highly interactive general application programs that respond in real time. The shallow version of the third objective is that students learn how to construct games that are sophisticated enough to include a complex dynamic virtual environment. The deeper version of this objective is that students learn to use a wide range of data structures, control structures and programming constructs. The shallow version of the fourth objective is that students write computer games that are capable of being stopped and then resumed again at a later time. the deep version of this objective is that students will learn how to design and use persistent data in their programs that is written to disk and read from disk.
 After completing the course, students should understand the concepts: object, class, selection control structure (if), repetition control structures (while, for), variable, function, function parameter, and sequences (Strings, Lists, Tuples, etc.). Students should be able to use these concepts to construct robust Python programs that solve computational problems.

**2 - Introduction to the Foundations of Computation II- CMPUT 175**

**Objectives**

>This two course sequence is a small introduction to the foundations of a major part of Computing Science: expressing problems precisely, solving them algorithmically by showing how to construct a solution, and then implementing that solution by writing a program.
Our approach in this course is problem-driven. We will take a problem and attempt to solve it. In the process of developing an algorithmic solution, we will introduce key computing concepts. Our intention is that every abstract concept should be grounded in concrete examples.
Our emphasis will be more on computation and problem solving than all the details of a particular programming language for implementing a solution. Our goal is to develop your intuitions for a variety of complementary styles of computation.

**3 - Formal Systems and Logic in Computing Science - CMPUT 272**

**Objectives**

>Problem solving and discrete mathematics underlie every aspect of computing science,
from the design of hardware and software to the theory of computation. In CMPUT 272, students
learn the fundamentals of discrete mathematics and use that knowledge to solve problems and
communicate the correctness of their solutions.
