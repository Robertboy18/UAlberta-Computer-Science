#Pong

The Pong game from Atari is one of the earliest arcade games. 
In this lab, you will create a graphical two-player Pong game. 
The left player controls the left paddle by pressing and holding down the q key to move the paddle up 
The a key to move the paddle down. 
The right player controls the right paddle by pressing and holding down the p key to move the paddle up 
The l key to move the paddle down.
These keys were chosen since q and a are on the left side of the keyboard and p and l are on the right side so both players can share a single keyboard and not get in each others way.
