Robert on Akrash ER model :
A pretty well made ER Model. Followed the rules and most of it is covered except that
there are minor mistakes such as number of tags must be a set value attribute instead.
Well spaced out and various constraints are added.

Robert on Tanya ER model :
On first glance this model seems to be concise and well made. One mistake which I found out was that
in the Badge Entity ; Class,Date is a joined super key however it is not minimal and hence not a key.
On the other hand everything else is pretty much neat and follows the rules well.
